            <h2>Three Geographic Regions</h2>
            <p>Nepal's geography can be divided into three distinct regions, each with its own unique characteristics and climate. These regions run parallel to each other from east to west across the country.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>1. The Himalayan Region</h3>
            <p>The Himalayan region is located in the northern part of Nepal and contains some of the world's highest mountains. This region includes Mount Everest (8,848.86 meters), the highest peak on Earth, along with seven other peaks above 8,000 meters. The region is characterized by extreme altitudes, glaciers, and a cold climate. Despite its harsh conditions, this region is popular among mountaineers and trekkers from around the world.</p>

            <h3>2. The Hilly Region</h3>
            <p>The Hilly region, also known as the Hill or Pahar region, lies between the Himalayas and the Terai plains. This region consists of the Mahabharat Range and several valleys, including the Kathmandu Valley. With elevations ranging from 610 to 4,876 meters, this region has a temperate climate and is the most densely populated area of Nepal. Major cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara are located in this region. The hills are characterized by terraced farming, where rice, wheat, and other crops are grown.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>3. The Terai Region</h3>
            <p>The Terai region is the lowland area in southern Nepal, extending along the border with India. This flat, fertile plain is part of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and is characterized by tropical and subtropical vegetation. The Terai is Nepal's most productive agricultural region, producing rice, wheat, sugarcane, and jute. This region is also home to several national parks and wildlife reserves, including Chitwan National Park, which hosts endangered species like the one-horned rhinoceros and Bengal tiger.</p>

            <h2>Climate</h2>
            <p>Nepal's climate varies greatly depending on altitude and region. The Terai has a tropical climate, the hills have a temperate climate, and the Himalayas experience an alpine climate. The country experiences four main seasons: spring, summer monsoon, autumn, and winter.</p>
