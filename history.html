        <h1>History of Nepal</h1>
        <p class="intro">Nepal's history spans millennia, from ancient civilizations to modern democracy.</p>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Ancient Period</h2>
            <p>The history of Nepal dates back to ancient times, with evidence of human settlements in the Kathmandu Valley dating back to the Stone Age. According to Buddhist and Hindu scriptures, the Kathmandu Valley was once a lake, which was drained by the bodhisattva Manjushree with his sword, creating the fertile valley we see today.</p>
            
            <p>Nepal is famously known as the birthplace of Lord Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama), who was born in Lumbini around 563 BCE. This makes Nepal a significant pilgrimage site for Buddhists worldwide.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Medieval Period - The Malla Dynasty</h2>
            <p>The Malla Dynasty ruled the Kathmandu Valley from the 12th to the 18th century. This period is often referred to as the golden age of art and architecture in Nepal. The Mallas built magnificent palaces, temples, and monuments, many of which still stand today in the cities of Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur. The valley was divided into three kingdoms during this time, leading to artistic competition that resulted in remarkable architectural achievements.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Unification of Nepal</h2>
            <p>In 1768, Prithvi Narayan Shah, the king of the small principality of Gorkha, conquered the Kathmandu Valley and began the unification of Nepal. He and his successors expanded the kingdom through military campaigns, bringing various small kingdoms and principalities under one rule. This marked the beginning of the Shah Dynasty, which would rule Nepal for the next two and a half centuries.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Rana Regime</h2>
            <p>From 1846 to 1951, Nepal was ruled by the hereditary prime ministers from the Rana family, while the Shah kings remained as figureheads. The Rana regime isolated Nepal from the outside world and maintained strict control over the country. This period saw limited development and modernization.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Modern Nepal</h2>
            <p>In 1951, the Rana regime was overthrown, and King Tribhuvan was restored to power. Nepal began to open up to the world and embarked on a path of modernization. The country saw various political changes, including the introduction of democracy, followed by periods of monarchy and political instability.</p>
            
            <p>In 2006, a people's movement led to significant political changes. In 2008, Nepal was declared a Federal Democratic Republic, ending the 240-year-old monarchy. The country adopted a new constitution in 2015, establishing Nepal as a federal democratic republic with seven provinces.</p>

            <h2>Nepal Today</h2>
            <p>Today, Nepal continues to develop as a democratic nation, working to improve its economy, infrastructure, and social welfare while preserving its rich cultural heritage and natural beauty. The country remains a popular destination for tourists, mountaineers, and spiritual seekers from around the world.</p>
