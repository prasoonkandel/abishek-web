            <h3>Dashain</h3>
            <p>Dashain is the longest and most important festival in Nepal, celebrated in September or October. This 15-day festival honors the goddess Durga and celebrates the victory of good over evil. Families come together to receive blessings from elders, exchange gifts, and enjoy feasts. The festival culminates with animal sacrifices and the application of tika (a mixture of rice, yogurt, and vermillion) on the forehead as a blessing.</p>
            
            <h3>Tihar</h3>
            <p>Tihar, also known as Deepawali or the Festival of Lights, is the second most important festival in Nepal. Celebrated for five days in October or November, Tihar honors different animals and the goddess of wealth, Laxmi. During Tihar, homes and streets are decorated with oil lamps and colorful lights. Each day honors a different creature: crows, dogs, cows, and oxen, with the third day dedicated to Laxmi. The festival is marked by singing, dancing, and family gatherings.</p>

            <p>Nepal celebrates many other festivals including Holi (the festival of colors), Buddha Jayanti (Buddha's birthday), Indra Jatra, and many more, each with its own unique traditions and significance.</p>
